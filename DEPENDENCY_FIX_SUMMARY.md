# Dependency Issue Fix Summary

## Problem
The app was failing with the error:
```
Uncaught Exception:
Error: Cannot find module 'webidl-conversions'
```

This occurred because `webidl-conversions` is a transitive dependency of `whatwg-url` (used by `node-fetch` and `@notionhq/client`) that wasn't being properly bundled in the Electron app.

## Root Cause
- `webidl-conversions` is a dependency of `whatwg-url`
- `whatwg-url` is used by `node-fetch` 
- `node-fetch` is used by `@notionhq/client`
- The dependency wasn't being included in the final app bundle

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Explicit Dependency
Added `webidl-conversions` as an explicit dependency in `package.json`:
```json
"webidl-conversions": "^3.0.1"
```

### 2. Enhanced Electron Builder Configuration
Added configuration to ensure all dependencies are properly bundled:
```json
"asar": true,
"includeSubNodeModules": true
```

### 3. Fixed Code Signing Issues
Disabled code signing for development builds:
```json
"identity": null
```

## Build Targets

### Working Build Targets:
- **Directory build**: `pnpm run dist:mac:dir` - Creates app in `release/mac-arm64/`
- **Zip build**: `pnpm run dist:mac:unsigned` - Creates `Track App-1.0.1-arm64-mac.zip`

### DMG Issues:
- DMG creation fails due to `hdiutil` process errors
- This is a macOS-specific issue with disk space or permissions
- Workaround: Use zip distribution instead

## Testing

### Dependency Verification:
```bash
./test-dependencies.sh
```
This script verifies that all required dependencies are included:
- ✅ webidl-conversions
- ✅ whatwg-url  
- ✅ node-fetch

### App Startup Test:
```bash
./test-app-start.sh
```
This script tests if the app can start without the dependency error.

## Current Status
✅ **FIXED**: The `webidl-conversions` dependency issue is resolved
✅ **WORKING**: App builds successfully with all dependencies included
✅ **TESTED**: Dependencies are properly bundled in the final app

## Distribution
For distribution, use the zip file:
- `release/Track App-1.0.1-arm64-mac.zip`
- Users can extract and run the app
- App will show "unidentified developer" warning (normal for unsigned apps)

## Next Steps for Production
1. **Code Signing**: Get Apple Developer account for proper code signing
2. **DMG Creation**: Fix DMG creation issues (may require disk space cleanup)
3. **App Store**: Consider Mac App Store distribution for better user experience
