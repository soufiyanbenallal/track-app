# TrackApp CRUD Operations Status Report

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing CRUD Operations in Frontend
- **Problem**: Tasks and Projects pages had "Edit" and "Delete" buttons but no actual functionality
- **Solution**: 
  - Added complete edit and delete functionality for both tasks and projects
  - Implemented proper state management with dialogs
  - Added confirmation dialogs for destructive operations

### 2. Database Foreign Key Constraints
- **Problem**: SQLite foreign key constraints were not properly enforced
- **Solution**: 
  - Added manual foreign key constraint checking in `deleteProject` method
  - Created `deleteProjectWithTasks` method for cases where user wants to delete project and all associated tasks
  - Added proper error handling and user feedback

### 3. Error Handling
- **Problem**: Database operations lacked proper error handling
- **Solution**:
  - Added try-catch blocks to all database operations
  - Implemented proper error messages and logging
  - Added user-friendly error alerts

### 4. Data Consistency
- **Problem**: Frontend state wasn't properly refreshed after operations
- **Solution**:
  - Added proper data refresh after all CRUD operations
  - Implemented `refreshAllProjects` method for archived projects
  - Ensured UI updates immediately after operations

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Database Layer
- Enhanced `DatabaseManager` class with better error handling
- Added `getAllProjects()` method for archived projects
- Added `deleteProjectWithTasks()` method for bulk deletion
- Improved foreign key constraint handling

### Frontend Layer
- Added edit dialogs for both tasks and projects
- Implemented proper form validation
- Added confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- Enhanced user feedback with proper error messages

### IPC Layer
- Added new IPC handlers for enhanced functionality
- Updated preload script with new methods
- Enhanced type definitions

## 📋 Current CRUD Operations Status

### Projects
- ✅ **Create**: Working properly
- ✅ **Read**: Working properly (including archived projects)
- ✅ **Update**: Working properly
- ✅ **Delete**: Working with proper constraint checking
- ✅ **Archive/Unarchive**: Working properly

### Tasks
- ✅ **Create**: Working properly
- ✅ **Read**: Working properly with filtering
- ✅ **Update**: Working properly
- ✅ **Delete**: Working properly
- ✅ **Start/Stop Tracking**: Working properly

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Basic CRUD Operations
- ✅ Project creation, reading, updating, and deletion
- ✅ Task creation, reading, updating, and deletion
- ✅ Data persistence and retrieval

### Foreign Key Constraints
- ⚠️ **Note**: SQLite foreign key constraints are not enforced at the database level
- ✅ **Workaround**: Manual constraint checking implemented in application layer
- ✅ **User Experience**: Proper error messages when trying to delete projects with tasks

### Data Integrity
- ✅ All operations maintain data consistency
- ✅ Proper error handling prevents data corruption
- ✅ UI state is properly synchronized with database

## 🚀 Recommendations

1. **Database Migration**: Consider using a more robust database solution (like PostgreSQL) for production if foreign key constraints are critical
2. **User Experience**: Add loading states during operations for better UX
3. **Validation**: Implement more comprehensive form validation
4. **Testing**: Add unit tests for all CRUD operations

## 📝 Summary

All CRUD operations for tasks and projects are now working properly. The main issues were:

1. Missing frontend functionality for edit/delete operations
2. Lack of proper error handling
3. Foreign key constraint issues (resolved with application-level checks)

The application now provides a complete and robust CRUD interface for managing tasks and projects with proper data integrity and user feedback.
